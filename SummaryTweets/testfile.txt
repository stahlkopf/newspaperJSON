Summarizing web pages have recently gained much attention
from researchers. Until now two main types of approaches have
been proposed for this task: content- and context-based methods.
Both of them assume fixed content and characteristics of web
documents without considering their dynamic nature. However
the volatility of information published on the Internet argue for
the implementation of more time-aware techniques. This paper
proposes a new approach towards automatic web page description,
which extends the concept of a web page by the temporal
dimension. Our method provides a broader view on web
document summarization and can complement the existing
techniques.
